Regretfully notebook displays are distorted here. I provided links to my databrics notebooks in a hope that they will look better there.

Other chapter scripts is the same as in the book. They are still mostly Python 2. They all run fine (after fixing them to be Python 3) except for Chapter 31. Working with it I got error messages, and after contacting Spark Deep Learning forum I got a response that it does not work at the moment, which was December of 2019.
