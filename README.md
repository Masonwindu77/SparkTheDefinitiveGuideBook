# SparkTheDefinitiveGuideBook
Book study for "Spark: The definitive guide" by Bill Chambers, Matei Zaharia

This is my work for the book. There are pyspark notebooks in the following repo: https://github.com/databricks/Spark-The-Definitive-Guide
Some of notebooks missing lines which are given in the book, so I've added them with some comments and additional cells.
