# "Spark: The Definitive Guide" Book Study
The book "Spark: The definitive guide" by Bill Chambers, Matei Zaharia (1st edition) is abberviated as STDG in this repository.

Here is my practice for the book. Authors provided PySpark and Scala notebooks in a following repository: 

[https://github.com/databricks/Spark-The-Definitive-Guide](https://github.com/databricks/Spark-The-Definitive-Guide)

Some of notebooks missed lines which are provided in STDG, so I've added them. In a few places in the book and in the repository we can see code for Python 2 while I use Python 3. I changed everything to Python 3. In some places code does not work anymore, may be depreciated after updates. I tried to fix it as much as I can. Plus in my noteboooks with comments I introduced code lines when I wanted to learn more about examples. 

Datasets which were used in the book are mounted to the Databricks File System:
https://docs.databricks.com/getting-started/databricks-datasets.html
They could be accessed directly from a databrick notebook.
