# "Spark: The Definitive Guide" Book Study
The book ("Spark: The definitive guide" by Bill Chambers, Matei Zaharia(O'Reilly), Copyright 2018 Databricks, Inc., 978-1-491-91221-8) is abberviated as STDG in this repository.

Here is my practice for the book. Authors provided PySpark and Scala notebooks in a following repository: 

[https://github.com/databricks/Spark-The-Definitive-Guide](https://github.com/databricks/Spark-The-Definitive-Guide)

Some of notebooks missed lines which are provided in STDG, so I've added them. In a few places in the book and in the repository we can see code for Python 2 while I use Python 3. I changed everything to Python 3. In some places code does not work anymore, may be depreciated after updates. Although it looks like it was copied from corresponding Scala scripts. I tried to fix it as much as I can. Plus in my noteboooks with comments I introduced code lines when I wanted to learn more about examples. 

Datasets which were used in the book are mounted to the Databricks File System:
https://docs.databricks.com/getting-started/databricks-datasets.html
They could be accessed directly from a databrick notebook.
