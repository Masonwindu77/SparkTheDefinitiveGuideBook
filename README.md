# SparkTheDefinitiveGuideBook
Book study for "Spark: The definitive guide" by Bill Chambers, Matei Zaharia

This is my practice for the book. Authors provided pyspark notebooks in the following repository: 

[https://github.com/databricks/Spark-The-Definitive-Guide](https://github.com/databricks/Spark-The-Definitive-Guide)

Some of notebooks missed lines which are provided in the book, so I've added them. In a few places in the book and in the repository we can see code for Python 2 while I use Python 3. I changed everything to Python 3.  Plus I introduced code lines when I wanted to learn more about examples.
